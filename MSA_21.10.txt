Tools: - flutter(dart)
- SoundPool/MediaPlayer libraries
- AudioRecord

Practices: - separation of concerns (UI, app logic-what the app does, data layer-how it handles data)
- architecture: - pattern: mvc (Model View Controller) -> Model for data and logic; View to see UI elements and listent for user interaction; Controller handles input and updates Model/View
- for flutter use Provider
